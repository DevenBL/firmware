### Other Distributions

#### GNOME Firmware

There is a standalone GUI called GNOME Firmware for distributions that can't use the above integrations; it's available for many distributions, even ones that don't use GNOME. You need to install it via your package manager.

Once that's done, open Firmware Update; this will show you all the supported devices in the left menu. If an update is available, you can install it using the button at the bottom right.

You can check for updates by clicking on the hamburger menu and selecting "Check for Updates".

#### Terminal Method

You can manage your firmware and install updates from the terminal if none of the above options is available.

###### Check for Updates

From your terminal window, type in the below command:

``` bash
fwupdmgr refresh
```

###### Install Updates

From your terminal window, type in the below command:

``` bash
fwupdmgr update
```

###### Reboot

The update will install upon the next reboot cycle. Ensure the power stays connected during the update, which may take 2-3 minutes to complete. Do not power off the machine during the update.

Specific updates require confirmation when installed; this will appear as a grey screen with blue text. If you see this screen, please selectÂ **Proceed with Flash Update.**

If you would like to test the latest updates before their official release, type the below command into your terminal window:

``` bash
fwupdmgr enable-remote lvfs-testing
```
