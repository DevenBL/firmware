### Other Distributions

#### GNOME Firmware

There is a standalone GUI called GNOME Firmware for distributions that can't use the above integrations; it's available for many distributions, even ones that don't use GNOME. You need to install it via your package manager.

Once that's done, open Firmware Update; this will show you all the supported devices in the left menu. If an update is available, you can install it using the button at the bottom right.

You can check for updates by clicking on the hamburger menu and selecting "Check for Updates".
